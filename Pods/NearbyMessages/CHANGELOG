Version 0.10.0 - March 2016
=============================
Resolved Issues:

  - Fixed some memory leaks.
  - Don't play audio if the current route isn't the speaker.
  - Don't call the GNSPermission callback until the user has responded to the
    Nearby permission dialog. This gives the app the ability to inform the user
    that Nearby will not function if permission is denied.
  - Apps that scan for beacons were required to add the bluetooth-central
    background mode to their Info.plist files, even though they're only doing
    foreground scanning.  This is no longer necessary.
  - Sometimes publications would persist on the server after they had been
    deallocated, causing their messages to continue to be delivered to nearby
    devices for about 5 minutes longer.  This has been fixed.
  - Type-less subscriptions should receive messages of all types, but this
    wasn't happening.  This has been fixed.

New Features:

  - iBeacon support.  Apps that scan for beacons can now receive messages from
    iBeacons as well as Eddystone beacons.
  - Unlike Eddystone scanning, iBeacon scanning causes iOS to ask for location
    permission.  If you only want to scan for Eddystone beacons, you can disable
    iBeacon scanning and avoid this permission dialog.
  - Publication/subscription status callbacks.  Track the status (inactive,
    starting, active) to update your app's UI.
  - Simplified Nearby permission dialog, and the ability to override it with
    an application-specific solution.

Deprecations:

  - The GNSMessageManager methods for creating publications and subscriptions
    with extra parameters have been deprecated in favor of the more flexible
    block-based methods, which allow new parameters to be added in the future.
    For example, here is the old way to pass a strategy when creating a
    publication:

    ```objective-c
    _publication = [_messageManager publicationWithParams:
        [GNSPublicationParams paramsWithMessage:message strategy:strategy]];
    ```

    And here is the new way:

    ```objective-c
    _publication = [_messageManager publicationWithMessage:message
                                               paramsBlock:^(GNSPublicationParams *params) {
                                                 params.strategy = strategy;
                                               }];
    ```

  - Simplification of beacon scanning parameters in subscriptions.  Beacon
    parameters are now separate and less confusing; there's no need to specify
    the set of mediums and set it to scan mode, since these can be inferred.
    The old parameters have been deprecated.  For example, here is the old way
    to create a beacon scanning subscription:

    ```objective-c
    GNSStrategy *beaconStrategy =
        [GNSStrategy strategyWithParamsBlock:^(GNSStrategyParams *params) {
          params.includeBLEBeacons = YES;
          params.discoveryMediums = kGNSDiscoveryMediumsBLE;
          params.discoveryMode = kGNSDiscoveryModeScan;
        }];
    GNSSubscriptionParams *beaconParams =
        [GNSSubscriptionParams paramsWithMessageNamespace:@"com.mycompany.mybeaconservice"
                                                     type:@"mybeacontype"
                                                 strategy:beaconStrategy];
    _beaconSubscription =
        [_messageManager subscriptionWithParams:beaconParams
                            messageFoundHandler:messageFoundHandler
                             messageLostHandler:messageLostHandler];
    ```

    And here is the new way:

    ```objective-c
    _beaconSubscription = [_messageManager
        subscriptionWithMessageFoundHandler:messageFoundHandler
                         messageLostHandler:messageLostHandler
                                paramsBlock:^(GNSSubscriptionParams *params) {
                                  params.deviceTypesToDiscover = kGNSDeviceBLEBeacon;
                                  params.messageNamespace = @"com.mycompany.mybeaconservice";
                                  params.type = @"mybeacontype";
                                }];
    ```

Version 0.9.7 - November 2015
=============================
Resolved Issues:

  - Nearby no longer disrupts audio being played by the app using Nearby.
  - Reduced network traffic in some cases.
  - Improved latency in some cases.
  - Display the Nearby permission dialog only in cases where iOS requires
    microphone or Bluetooth permission.
  - Improved the Nearby permission dialog to make it less confusing.

Other changes:

  - Added README with code examples.
  - Added this CHANGELOG file.
  - Added docs to GNSPermission.

Known issues:

  - An unexpected Bluetooth pairing dialog may be displayed when Nearby is used
    between iOS 8 and iOS 9 devices.  It appears to be an Apple bug, and there's
    no known workaround besides upgrading to iOS 9.  Details here:

Version 0.9.6 - October 2015
============================
Resolved Issues:

  - Improved reliability.
  - Reduced latency.
  - Reduced library size.
  - Fixed a bug that caused an occasional crash.
  - Updated translations.

Version 0.9.5 - July 2015
=========================
Features:

  - Added debug logging to GNSMessageManager, which can be helpful in tracking
    down problems encountered by clients.  To enable debug logging, add this to
    your initialization code:

    ```objective-c
    [GNSMessageManager setDebugLoggingEnabled:YES];
    ```

Resolved Issues:

  - Fixed a memory leak.
  - Added new translations.
  - Reduced network bandwidth a bit.
  - Fixed Swift compile errors.
  - Added a missing dependency (CoreMedia) to fix a link error.

Version 0.9.4 - July 2015
=========================
Initial public release.

Resolved Issues:

  - Auto-refresh of pubs/subs; they no longer time out after 10 minutes.
  - Audio crash fix.
  - Improved reliability.
